title: Software Development Lifecycle
---
- Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) refers to the entire process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software products. The SDLC contains several parts/stages. 
# Phases of SDLC
## Planning and Requirements
- This is the first stage of the SDLC, which defines and outlines what is required of the product, who the product caters to and how it fills a gap in the market.
- Requirements deals with the execution of the above ideas and details the requirements from several perspectives - system-level, function, hardware and so on. The applicable stakeholder in each of these parts needs to sign off the requirements for their ground.
- These requirements also need to be analysed to verify if they match the plans and are practical and cost-efficient.

## Design and Architecture
- The design gets deeper into the execution of the project and outlines the various modules in the code, their implementation and how they're to be tested.
- For example, if the code is written in an OO language like Java, the design would include the various projects, packages, classes, interfaces, methods and so on.

## Development
- This is the stage in which the code is actually written, along with extensive unit testing and debugging for the code.
- If the design documents are written well, writing the code can be a relatively simple task since there isn't much left to the imagination of the developer. Ideally, coding guidelines should also be provided to the devs.

## Testing
- Once the code is written and the core product is available for use, it must be tested thoroughly, to check for defects and bugs and verify if meets the requirements and objectives laid out initially.
- Naturally, testing is a part of all the previous phases too, especially in the modern age.

## Maintenance
- Once the product is deployed and used by customers, it might contain problems or might be lacking in features. Changes and upgrades made to the code after deployment are part of the maintenance phase.

# SDLC Models
## V-Model
- This is a model of SDLC that follows a V-shape to sequentially execute and verify the various stages of the SDLC. The development and testing of a particular phase go together.
- The development phase of each step takes place only after the completion of the previous step.

## Agile Method
- This isn't a model, as such, but is a set of guidelines and principles to approach a project.
- Agile methods focus on implementation and delivering a product as soon as possible and rapidly implementing changes that may be required.
- All the SDLC phases are implemented in iterations to ensure that a working product is available as soon as possible and upgrades are incrementally added to it.

- Beyond what's discussed above, there are other important activities in the SDLC process such as project management, quality inspection and documentation.
- One such document that is commonly used is the Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM), which maps artifacts (code and documentation) from the development phase to those of other phases.
