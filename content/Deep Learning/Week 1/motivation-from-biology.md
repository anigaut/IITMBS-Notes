title: Motivation from Biological Neurons
---

- Neural networks are a foundational technology in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML that is based on neural networks. 
- Needless to say, the inspiration of using this framework in ML is the brain. A neuron is the most fundamental unit of a neural network. A neuron contains four parts:
	- **Dendrite**: receives signals from other neurons.
	- **Synapse**: point of connection to other neurons.
	- **Soma**: processes the information.
	- **Axon**: transmits the output of the neuron.
- This is a very simplified account of how neurons work. In reality, there's a massive network of interconnected neurons in our brains, which perform different functions from each other and get activated to different stimuli. 
- Further, these neurons are also arranged in a hierarchy of layers. Information passes through each layer, which performs some function, and generates some output at the end. 
- While this hardly explains how the brain works, it works as the basis for how neural networks work in DL.
