# Deep Learning Notes

These are my notes for the Deep Learning course of the Degree Level in the IIT Madras BS Program. The content has been taken from Prof. Mithesh Khapra's course [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ2ps__7DhBZVxMrSkTIcG6zZBDKUXCnM). Several screenshots have also been taken from his lecture slides to complement my notes.

I recommend everyone to watch the lectures before using these notes. They are meant to be a complement, not a substitute for the course lectures.
